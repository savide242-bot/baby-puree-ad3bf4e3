  subtitle: "What your baby's body actually needs, month by month",
  image: "needs",
  intro:
    "Every parent asks the same quiet question at 2am: is my baby getting enough? The honest answer is that your baby's needs change dramatically in the first two years, faster than at almost any other stage of life. A newborn doubles their birth weight by around 5 months and triples it by 12 months, a growth rate that, if sustained into adulthood, would be biologically impossible to fuel. Understanding the actual numbers behind energy, protein, fat, iron, and fluid needs takes the guesswork out of feeding and replaces anxiety with confidence. This chapter walks through exactly what your baby needs at each stage, in plain language backed by pediatric nutrition science from the WHO, the AAP, and the NHS. We will cover breastfed and formula-fed babies, preterm infants, how to read a growth chart, and the red flags that mean it is time to call your pediatrician. By the end, you will be able to look at a plate, a bottle, or a growth curve and know whether it is doing its job.",

A term newborn needs roughly 95 to 115 kcal per kilogram of body weight per day, which works out to about 450 to 550 kcal per day for a baby around 4 to 5 kg. Protein needs are proportionally high too, about 1.5 to 2 g per kg per day, but because milk is nutrient-dense, this is easily met by breast milk or standard infant formula without any additional food or water.",

Cluster feeding in the evenings is normal and does not mean your milk supply is inadequate; it is a common pattern tied to circadian rhythm development. Weight gain of roughly 150 to 200 g (5 to 7 oz) per week is the expected benchmark for the first three months, though this naturally slows afterward.",

This is also the period when many parents feel pressure, from relatives or social media, to start solids early.

Formula, by contrast, has a fixed nutrient profile per scoop, regulated to approximate the average composition of mature breast milk, which means formula-fed babies benefit from consistent, predictable preparation: always follow the can's water-to-powder ratio exactly, since over-diluting can cause inadequate growth and electrolyte problems, while under-diluting can strain immature kidneys.",

Neither pattern is superior nutritionally when total daily intake and growth are adequate. Iron content also differs: virtually all infant formula sold in the US and UK is iron-fortified, while breast milk is naturally low in iron but that iron is very efficiently absorbed, roughly 50 percent absorption compared to about 10 percent from fortified formula.",

Zinc follows a similar pattern to iron: stores deplete around the same age, and the same foods (meat, legumes, fortified cereal) that supply iron also tend to supply zinc, which is why 'first foods should be fruit' is actually one of the least evidence-based pieces of common feeding advice.",
